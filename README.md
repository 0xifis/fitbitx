This is a Unity VR game meants to be used with an indoor cycling bike. The accomponayiny low-cost
RPM sensor and Fitbit integration feed RPM and heartrate data to the game respectively. The RPM 
data controls the speed of the in-game bike and the heartrate controls the speed of the zombies. 
The objective of the game is to get away from the zombies and in so doing, enjoy a nice, rewarding
 cycling workout.
